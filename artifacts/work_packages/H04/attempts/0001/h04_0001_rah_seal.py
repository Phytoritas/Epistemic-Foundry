"""Append H04-0001 PASS evidence while global completion remains false.

Authoring note (read before running).  This seal was authored as a bounded
seal-prep hand that was instructed not to touch ``.rah/``, so it cannot read the
live ledger to pin the parent generation, its count, its tail evidence id, its
manifest hash, or reserve this attempt's core/final evidence ids.  All six
ledger pins are therefore left as the sentinel ``FILL_FROM_LEDGER`` and the seal
refuses to run until the parent fills every one of them from the live ledger
tail (the current committed generation and the next two free evidence ids)
before running preflight/core/final.  Everything else -- summaries, product and
artifact hashes, flat-snapshot verification, atomic core/final commits -- is
derived exactly as the sealed A01/A02/A03/B03/H03 templates do.

H04 depends on H02 and H03.  Its product bytes are the bounded capability-probe
module ``packages/plugin-host/src/capability-probe/capability-probe.mjs`` and its
two compatibility test suites ``tests/compatibility/hooks/
hook-feature-probe.test.mjs`` and ``hook-degraded-mode.test.mjs``, which are the
two required checks, attested through the attempt-directory Node harness.
