"""Prove the T06 gate is discoverable by the project's own packaging config.

``src/epistemic_foundry/adapters`` was introduced by T05 and already carries a
marker; T06 adds a second versioned subpackage under it.  Both levels are still
checked, because a wheel that shipped the parent without this subpackage would
import cleanly from a checkout and fail only after installation — the exact
failure a discovery check exists to catch before release.  The discovery mode
is read from pyproject rather than assumed, so a change there fails here.
