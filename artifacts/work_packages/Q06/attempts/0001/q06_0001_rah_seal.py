"""Append Q06-0001 PASS evidence while global completion remains false.

Authoring note (read before running).  This is a seal-PREP artifact.  It was
authored by a session instructed not to touch ``.rah/``, so it cannot read the
live ledger to pin the parent generation identifier, its manifest hash, or the
exact evidence identifiers this seal will issue.  ALL SIX ledger-derived pins are
therefore left as the sentinel ``FILL_FROM_LEDGER`` and the seal refuses to run
until the parent fills them from the live ledger tail:

* ``EXPECTED_PARENT`` - the current committed RAH generation (e.g.
  ``000264-XXXXXXXX``), the tail the Q06 core generation will branch from.
* ``EXPECTED_PARENT_COUNT`` - the number of preserved generations at that tail.
* ``EXPECTED_PARENT_EVIDENCE`` - the latest evidence id at that tail (the final
  closeout evidence of the package sealed immediately before Q06).
* ``EXPECTED_PARENT_MANIFEST_SHA256`` - the sha256 of that tail generation's
  ``generation-manifest.json``.
* ``CORE_EVIDENCE_ID`` - the next contiguous evidence id the Q06 core commits.
* ``FINAL_EVIDENCE_ID`` - the following evidence id the Q06 closeout commits.

Read them from ``.rah/ralph`` (current pointer, ``generations`` count, and the
evidence ledger tail) before running and set all six together.  Everything else
- attempt evidence, summaries, hashes, flat-snapshot verification - is derived
exactly as the R05/V05 templates do.  Do not run any mode until the six pins are
filled; ``assert_parent_pins`` fails closed while any remains a sentinel.
