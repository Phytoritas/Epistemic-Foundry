"""Append I03-0001 PASS evidence while global completion remains false.

Authoring note (read before running).  This seal was prepared by a bounded hand
that was instructed NOT to touch ``.rah/``, so it cannot read the live ledger to
pin the parent generation, its evidence id, its manifest hash, the retained
generation count, or the two evidence ids this seal will mint.  Every one of
those six pins is therefore left as the sentinel ``FILL_FROM_LEDGER`` and
``assert_parent_pins`` refuses to run until the parent fills them from the live
ledger tail (the generation committed by the current frontier's final closeout).
Everything else -- summaries, hashes, flat-snapshot verification, generation
accounting -- is derived exactly as the sealed templates do.  The parent, which
owns the ledger, fills the pins and runs preflight -> core -> final -> verify.
