"""Append Y04-0001 PASS evidence while global completion remains false.

Authoring note (read before running).  This seal was prepared by a bounded hand
during seal preparation that was instructed NOT to touch ``.rah/``, so it cannot
read the live ledger to pin the parent generation, its evidence id, its manifest
hash, the retained generation count, or the two evidence ids this seal will
mint.  Every one of those six pins is therefore left as the sentinel
``FILL_FROM_LEDGER`` and ``assert_parent_pins`` refuses to run until the parent
fills them from the live ledger tail (the generation committed by the current
frontier's final closeout).  Everything else -- summaries, hashes,
flat-snapshot verification, generation accounting -- is derived exactly as the
sealed templates do.  The parent, which owns the ledger, fills the pins and runs
preflight -> core -> final -> verify.
