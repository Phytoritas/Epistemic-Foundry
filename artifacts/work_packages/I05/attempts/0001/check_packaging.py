"""Prove the I05 intake engine is discoverable by the project's packaging config.

``src/epistemic_foundry/intake`` is a new package marker (authorized under
HD-EF4-I05-SCOPE-20260802-001), so unlike L05 there is a scope decision to
prove rather than assume: a marker that never reached the wheel would let the
engine import from a checkout and vanish from an installed distribution. The
discovery mode is read from pyproject instead of assumed, so a change there
fails here.
